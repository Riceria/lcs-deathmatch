![Box art](media/box-art.png "Box art of LCS Deathmatch")

LCS Deathmatch is a text-based, team management simulation game created in Java that is based on [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) and its esports scene[^1]. This game was created as the ISU for my Grade 12 ICS4U class as a way to practice OOP fundamentals.

## Features

- Create your own players and teams or use prepopulated rosters with pro players
    - View player stats and make roster changes
    - Remove players from the league
- Pit two teams against each other in a simple 20-40s simulation of a League of Legends game
    - Every second, either team has a chance to gain a kill/point based on team stats
    - The team with the most kills at the end of the match is the winner
- View the league's overall standings
